# 🌍 Global Supplier Insights AI Dashboard

**An executive-focused AI prototype for supplier cost, margin, and sourcing strategy analysis**

---

## Executive Summary

Modern supply chain organizations struggle to quickly answer critical questions such as:

- Which suppliers are driving the highest costs?
- Where are margins most at risk?
- How do regional or supplier cost changes impact profitability?
- Where should leadership focus negotiations or diversification efforts?

This prototype demonstrates how **AI-assisted analytics and conversational insights** can close this gap by combining supplier data, scenario modeling, and executive-style recommendations in a single, intuitive interface.

## What This Prototype Demonstrates

This is **not a production system** — it is a **conceptual, explainable prototype** designed to show *what is possible* and *how leadership might interact with such a system*.

### Key Capabilities

### 1. Supplier Cost & Profitability Visibility
- Rank suppliers by **unit cost** and **total margin**
- Quickly identify **high-cost** and **high-value** suppliers
- Focus leadership attention where it matters most

### 2. Regional & Commodity Trend Analysis
- Visualize cost and margin trends by **region (e.g., China, India, Asia)**
- Understand geographic exposure and sourcing concentration
- Spot emerging cost pressures early

### 3. What-If Cost Simulation
- Simulate supplier cost increases (e.g., tariffs, inflation, logistics shocks)
- Instantly see impact on **total spend** and **margin**
- Support proactive planning rather than reactive decisions

### 4. Executive-Style AI Advisor (Chatbot)
- Ask natural-language questions such as:
  - *“Which suppliers should we renegotiate with?”*
  - *“Where is margin risk highest?”*
  - *“Which regions show the most volatility?”*
- AI responses are:
  - Constrained to **3 concise bullet points**
  - Actionable and decision-oriented
  - Grounded in the actual data shown on screen

## Why This Matters for Leadership

Most supply chain tools:
- Are data-heavy but insight-light
- Require analysts to interpret dashboards
- Do not support scenario-based decision making in real time

This prototype explores a different model:
> **Executives interact directly with the system, ask strategic questions, and receive clear guidance.**

It illustrates how AI can move from **reporting** to **decision support**.

---

## Intended Audience

- Supply Chain Executives
- Procurement & Sourcing Leadership
- Finance & Margin Management Teams
- Product & Platform Leaders exploring AI-assisted decision tools

---

## Technology Overview (Prototype-Level)

- **Streamlit** — Rapid interactive dashboard for executive demos
- **Pandas** — Data aggregation and analytics
- **Plotly** — Clear, executive-friendly visualizations
- **OpenAI GPT (optional)** — Conversational AI for strategic insights
- **Python 3.x**

> AI gracefully falls back to mock insights if no API key is provided, ensuring the demo always works.

## What This Is — and Is Not

**This is:**
- A strategic prototype
- A communication tool for leadership and engineering teams
- A demonstration of AI product thinking

**This is not:**
- A production-ready system
- A replacement for ERP or SCM platforms
- A fully automated decision engine

---

## Future Extensions (Conceptual)

- Supplier risk scoring (geopolitical, logistics, financial health)
- Forecasting cost trends using historical patterns
- Integration with ERP / procurement systems
- Role-based views for GSMs, Finance, and Executives

---

## Why This Exists

This prototype was built to demonstrate how **AI-assisted insights can elevate supply chain decision-making**, reduce analysis friction, and help leaders focus on the few actions that move the bottom line.

*Built as an AI prototyping and product-thinking exercise.*
